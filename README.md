## Circle Animation

Circle Animation is a Java Swing application that displays circles and animates them within a window. The circles move randomly around the window, bouncing off the edges of the window as they move.

# Getting Started

To use Circle Animation, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Java from the Java website.

To run Circle Animation, you can compile and run the Main.java file. Alternatively, you can build the project using your favorite build tool and run the resulting jar file.

Once the application is running, you can click anywhere in the window to add circles. The size of the circles can be adjusted using the mouse wheel. The circles will start moving as soon as they are added to the window.

# Features
