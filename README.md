# Interactive-Circle-Animation-in-Java

### This repository contains a Java program that allows the user to create and manipulate circles with mouse clicks. The program utilizes multithreading to move the circles in real time and allows the user to change the size of the circles using the mouse wheel. Additionally, the program incorporates collision detection to make the circles bounce off the walls of the panel.
